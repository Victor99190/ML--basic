This is simple mathematical model of regresion of single and multiple varible using vectorization//
you can understand all the detail of code from andrew and machine learning course on coursera
it also consist of implementation of the logistic regresion using numpy . all the regire data for the logistic regresion is given on data folder 
it consist raw and cleaned data
